# Precision RAG: Automatic Prompt Engineering for Enterprise LLMs

This repository contains the development of a system for Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), designed to optimize the use of large language models (LLMs) in various business applications.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create an APE system that can:

- Automatically generate effective prompts for LLMs, tailored to specific tasks and objectives.
- Evaluate the quality of prompts through rigorous testing and ranking mechanisms.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system, enabling users to easily input objectives, receive generated prompts, and view evaluation results.

## Key Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) focus:** Leverages RAG techniques to enhance prompt effectiveness and relevance for enterprise LLMs.
- **Customizable prompt generation:** Generates multiple prompt options based on user input and desired outcomes.
- **Automatic test case generation:** Creates diverse test cases to evaluate prompts in various scenarios.
- **Comprehensive prompt testing and ranking:** Employs Monte Carlo matchmaking and ELO rating systems (or alternative methods) for robust evaluation.
- **User-friendly interface:** Facilitates easy data input, prompt output, and result visualization.
- **Integration with LLMs:** Seamlessly integrates with LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo for prompt testing and application.

## Technical Requirements

- **Programming languages:** Python, JavaScript (for UI)
- **Libraries and frameworks:** React and FastAPI
- **LLM access:** Requires access to LLM APIs (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo) for prompt testing and application.
